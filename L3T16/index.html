            <h2 id="AboutMeNav">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my coding portfolio, my name is Chris Booth and I will be your tour guide.
            </p>

            <h4>Joining the Tech World</h4>
            <p>Growing up, I would always see the actors on the big screen typing away at their keyboards, certain that their fingers would catch on
                fire from all the 'hacking' and 'computer whizzing' they were doing. I never thought that I would ever be able to do something so cool (I mean,
                being able to type that fast would surely cause finger aches, plus, how could I compete with that level of clearly complex mathematics and arithmetic?).
            </p>
            <p>But as I began my coding journey, I have learnt two important lessons: 1) Hollywood have deeply misrepresented what coding and the tech industry is,
                but also 2) I am darn good at coding. While I might not be the best coder out there, I am picking up things way faster than I thought and so many of
                the complex topics I have come across seems to be second nature to me - including OOP and Databases. While I've still got a lot to learn and my
                technical vocab definitely still needs so work, I believe that I am ready to take my first step into the tech world.
            </p>

            <h4>My Passions and Strengths</h4>
            <p> While I have discovered a great passion for coding, this has not been my first love. Writing and producing creative content were my first loves as a
                child and drove me to build a career in the journalism world. From writing fiction and non-fiction, to studying radio journalism, to being the first
                person in South Africa to obtain a Master of Arts in Health Journalism, I have always had a great desire to create enthralling content that not only
                inspires, but also informs and educates people. As I'm sure you can tell with my Health Journalism degree and my work with a children's radio station
                based at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, the topic of health is also one that is close to my heart, and it is something that I wish to bring
                along with me on my tech journey.
            </p>
            <p> This brings me to my key strengths. A logic focused mind, as well as a willingness to learn, a desire to create, and an almost stubborn-headed need to
                constantly perfect and build on my abilities, make me the ideal person to work in the tech industry. Empathy and kindness are also two major strengths
                that I possess, and while these not the most needed strengths in tech, they do allow me to be a great team player who is always patient and eager to work together to create a better world.
            </p>
            <p>For the final stage of the tour of my portfolio, please find my current projects, my professional experience, education and official strengths all outlined below.

        <h3>Project Management System | Java 18 & MySQL</h3>
        <p>
            For the Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev, I built a project management system
            for a small structural engineering firm called <em>Poised</em>.
            They do engineering needed to ensure the structural integrity of various buildings.
            The firm would use this program to keep track of the many projects they work on.
            This is done by taking in all the necessary information about a project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program makes it possible to update the information about each project,
            to finalise a project and create a customer invoice, to see a list of incomplete and overdue projects,
            and to find and select specific projects.

            The program makes use of Object-Oriented Programming and a MySQL database to keep track of the projects and build Project Objects.

        <h3>Shoe Warehouse Inventory | Python</h3>
        <p>
            For the Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev, I built a Capstone program that makes use of Object-Orientation Programming
            (classes and objects) to keep track of the stock at a shoe warehouse.
            It draws information about each shoe and its stock from a text document, printing it in an easy-to-read table.
            The program then allows the user to search each product by code, it also determines which product needs to be restocked,
            determines which product should go on sale, and determines the value of each product (based on the quantity and cost of the item).
            It also allows new products to be added to the inventory list and written to the external text document.
        </p>

        <h3>Task Manager | Python</h3>
        <p>
            This is a Capstone program for a small business or organisation to help them manager the tasks assigned to each member of the team.
            A user must login before they can add or edit any of the tasks or other users in the task manager.
            Making use of text files to store the user and task data, any user can add a task, view all tasks, view their own specific tasks,
            and edit or mark their tasks as complete. Only the admin user can register a new user, generate reports
            and view the statistics for the task manager.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>Financial Calculators | Python</h3>
        <p>
            For my first Capstone project during my Software Engineering Bootcamp, I built a program using Python with two different financial calculators:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an investment calculator</li>
            <li>a home loan repayment calculator</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The user can choose which calculator they would like to use before entering the details necessary for each financial calculation.
        If they choose the investment calculator, then the user has a further choice between simple and compound interest
        after they enter the necessary detail.</p>

        <h3>Booth In Japan</h3>
        <img src="" alt="Booth In Japan">
        <p>Teaching English in Japan was a great personal and professional experience that helped me grow as a person
            and develop my interpersonal skills. However, not wanting to leave my journalistic skills to rust,
            I started a blog called Booth In Japan where I wrote and shared articles about a variety of topics ranging
            from travel information, cultural information, and personal experiences. The blog was intended to act
            as a guide for those visiting Japan - particularly other South Africans. I also produced and edited a number of videos on this blog.</p>

        <h3>WHO's Reboot Health and Wellbeing Challenge</h3>
        <img src="" alt="Reboot Health and Wellbeing Challenge">
        <p>With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, RX Radio started a new project called Children's Voices on COVID-19 where we created PSA,
            captured children's experiences and provided entertainment during the lockdown. We felt it was important for children's voices
            to be heard and shared with other children around the world.</p>
        <p>This project was announced in July 2020 as one of the two winners of the UN and WHO's Reboot Health and Wellbeing Innovation Challenge
            - a victory which has lead us to be a part of the World Health Assembly in May 2021.</p>
